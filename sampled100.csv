1058543,female,24,indUnk,Sagittarius,"02,August,2004","        1 Corinthians 5:11 'But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner - not even to eat with such a person.'   Sounds somewhat simple now, right?  Wrong.  Applying this verse to my life is very hard.  My sister fits these things and now I need to figure out how to be obedient to this.  How much time is it okay to spend with her?  Are my parents supposed to ostricize her out of the family?  I don't know.  My uncle mostly, and also my cousins, probably claim to many people that they are Christians, yet they are drunks.  Am I not to go to any family functions?  Am I supposed to be like my Grandad and just pretend like it's not going on?  This is what I am going to seek out.         "
3440336,female,23,Arts,Virgo,"08,July,2004","       Having moved to Jersey City nearly a month ago, I had no idea that I would be packing up to camp out in my original homeland, the Philippines. Well, perhaps my homeland away from homeland...in New Jersey. Familiarizing myself with the new neighborhood, I strolled down West Side Avenue and was dumbfounded to see the large wooden sign overhead the local store with the carved lettering, Filipinas Market. Wait, that's Me. I'm a Filipina. I even have perfume called Filipina. The extraordinary woman who arranged my adoption back in 1980 gave it to me a few years ago for my birthday. I only use it on special occasions, hoping to make it last until the bottle is bone dry. And even then, it's like the puny little puddle of molasses like shampoo that might take days to finally ooze out, but if you add a little water and shake it up like a martini, voila, you have yourself watered down, bubbly, yet officially usable shampoo.  When I first started riding the bus to the path station, I found myself surrounded by distant relatives and familiar faces. And my nose! When I was young, some kids would ask my why my nose was flatter than theirs. It never bothered me, I was used to it, and as a tomboy, I could beat up the biggest boy in my class. In fact, up until high school I was known for being able to throw the ball farther than all the boys. OK, now I'm just bragging. But I would usually shrug off their perfectly innocent question and resume digging in the dirt, looking for gold using a twig.   When I was 14, my parents took me back to the Philippines, which allowed me to embrace the culture and to see my heritage. Granted, I was at the age where it was embarrassing to be seen with your parents and especially agitating when you have to wear a fanny pack, but it wasn't difficult to see that the Filipino people embraced a sweet demeanor and donned warm smiles. That would explain why I got the rep for 'Always Smiling,' in my 8th grade year book. I had to change schools after that, since every moment after that, when I did not display the freeze frame all whites Crest smile, people asked if I was OK. Recently, I have acquired more of a 'Don't mess with me, on subway, walking or anywhere look,' for city life though.  Waiting for the bus this morning, I met a woman, who knew from Adam and Eve that I was Filipino. She didn't believe that I worked in Manhattan, telling me the dreaded, 'you look like your still in high school...' tell me something I don't know. I tried to explain that I was from Connecticut but I think she may have been slightly confused. She was sweeter than a butter cookie and she made me feel right at home.          "

3367064,female,26,indUnk,Taurus,"29,July,2004","             The most hilarious movie I have seen this year.. a comedy movie with absolutely no trace of slapstick. (When was the last time Hollywood came up with a pure comedy?) The catch: the movie is in French, the subtitles can capture only so much of the essence of the dialogues.  It revolves around a tiny fishing village in Quebec, where the only job for men is to go and collect weekly welfare checks. A completely dull and dreary existence. Their lives takes a new turn when they come to know that a small industry is considering their village for a plant. That means employment for all the youth. But there is only one thing they lack: they need to find a permanent residing doctor for the village. They send out 'brochures' on their village to all doctors in Montreal. One urbane doctor bites and decides to check out the village to escape a traffic offense (didnt really understand that part). He loves cricket, and the villagers have no clue what 'cricket' is. With the help of internet and&nbsp; a Lagaan-type song, they end up creating costumes, a make-shift 'stadium' and bats from oars. Now the doctor comes to visit and he is shocked to see men clad in cricket costumes at a distance. He insists he wants to watch the match. Poor villagers have no clue how the game is played. Suddenly a wise man comes up with a brilliant idea and he starts jumping up and down saying he won the match. Everybody follows. The poor doctor is shocked that both sides seem to have won but leaves the game anyways, bedazzled.  Such hilarious sequences fill the movie. The game of seduction for a young doctor, by a whole village. The film sure deserves the box office success it enjoyed in Canada (the second highest-grosser of all time).  &nbsp;           "
3590478,female,34,Technology,Capricorn,"20,April,2004","              Short of being attached to the bumper of a pickup truck by a cock ring and being dragged around the 'great' state of Texas, I can't think of anything more painful than watching 'The Sweetest Thing,' which signals the end of Cameron Diaz's sanity, if not her career.  As far as I'm concerned, a great career move for Matthew Lillard would be decapitation.  Does anybody want to see Norm Macdonald in anything? At all? I'd like to see somebody toss him into the gorilla cage at the zoo and see how funny he can be. He screams 'actor' with the same conviction with which Richard Simmons screams 'straight.'  It appears that James Van Der Beek has spent the post-Dawson's Creek years receiving electroshock therapy.  In 'Mr. Wrong,' director Nick Castle combines two things that don't go together: romantic comedy and an episode of Bugs Bunny. After directing this and the awful 'Major Payne,' I think Nick should be required to sit in on all the screenings of his next movie and take questions afterward, such as this one: 'Can I beat the shit out of you in the parking lot, or should we get it over with here?'  Vertical Limit: . Climb, climb, climb, avalanche, climb, climb, Nitro-Glycerin explosion, climb, climb, awful dialogue, climb, climb, helicopter, climb, climb, cool action scenes that were shown to death in the previews, climb, climb, random death, climb, climb, credits. I just saved you 7 bucks.  I've always contended that Chris O'Donnell has the screen presence of a fried egg, and his performance here has done nothing to change my mind. Also on hand to humiliate himself is the formerly reliable actor Scott Glenn, who plays a gruff old mountain man looks like he's made of burlap. But the true standout of the cast is Robin Tunney. If there is a more vacuous and vacant actress currently alive in this world, then I'm Fred Gwynne. From her roles in The Craft to End of Days to Supernova, she is consistently and irretrievably awful. In Vertical Limit, she plays a climbing expert (excuse me while I snort Pepsi out of my nose) who spends the entire movie literally freezing to death, and Tunney can't even blow a nasal snot bubble convincingly.  Whoever thought Matthew Lillard should do Shakespeare has severe brain lesions. Whoever thought Alicia Silverstone should sing on camera is on drugs I never knew existed.   I feel bad for Jean-Claude Van Damme's proctologist. If his acting is any indication, it must take a lot of time and several hydraulic tools to get that guy's ass cheeks to separate. He walks around like he's some kind of frozen treat: Jean-Claude on a stick. You could sharpen a pencil if you got close enough to jam one into his rear end. The only thing stiffer than the guy's strut is his personality, which has all the flexibility of Margaret Thatcher at a rave after five double espressos.  This film is so bad that it actually casts doubt on the significance of Dylan's music career, because anybody whose soul is full of this much pretentious bullshit would barely be able to hold his own in a karaoke bar. If you didn't know that Dylan was more full of himself than a naked Tommy Lee on a heroin binge, you're about to learn.  Now, I don't know if they were paying Isabella Miko by the word or what, but all she does is scream and run around topless at the slightest provocation. I'm not sure this qualifies as acting so much as appropriate Hollywood party behavior, which may explain how Isabella got discovered.  Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy have better chemistry than Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Besides, Zeta-Jones could give Melanie Griffith a run for the 'Please Stop Acting Before I Choke on My Own Tongue' award. She plays the part like a 15-year-old who's just learned she isn't getting the Beemer for her sixteenth birthday.  I'm going to find Ted Danson and kick his ass for not beaning Shelly Long with a shot glass during 'Cheers' and eliminating that particular Hollywood plague at the source. The fact that the film studios haven't figured out yet that Shelly Long shouldn't be allowed in any more motion pictures is reason enough to hope for a massive earthquake that sends Hollywood to the bottom of the ocean floor.  The Corporation seems like the brainchild of 3 movie execs who aim to conceive a movie while completely high on marijuana. How’s THIS for a recipe? ”We take The Firm, that Cruise flick that’s ripped off more often than a hotel bathrobe, mix it with something old like The Stepford Wives, throw in a few pointless sex scenes, hire one of those 90210 freaks, and get Roger Corman to sign the check! Andrew Stevens will direct. He’d direct rush hour traffic for two donuts and cab fare. Oh, and call the Mom from ET. We need someone to overact and humiliate themselves badly.” ”Which 90210 kid? The short little Michael J. Fox clone, or the tall brooding James Dean wannabe?” ”No, I was thinking that bland lifeless blonde one! The one that’s NEVER BEEN IN A MOVIE before!” ”Ian Ziering???” Does he have an agent? Does he even have a phone?”  Speaking of stupid, has anyone else noticed that Tara Reid is so artificially tan that she looks like one of the Oompah-Loompahs from 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.' Her eyes appear so freakishly bright because of her unnatural skin tone that even when I close my eyes now, I can see the spots burned into my retinas.  The director of this movie is David Zucker, the guy who made 'Airplane.' It's hard to imagine what this guy has done to himself in the last couple of decades to become so unfunny, but my guess is that it probably involved Christian Science and LSD.  Here's the exact moment when I knew 'Die Another Day,' the 20th James Bond film, was going to get nuked: Madonna's cameo appearance. And it's not like the woman just walks across the screen and you say, 'Oh look, its Madonna.' No, she has a speaking part with actual full sentences. I don't know where the definition of 'kiss of death' is in the Hollywood lexicon but 'Madonna has a speaking part' is an indication that you're getting close. This woman couldn't be stiffer if she had an icicle in her rectum.   Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this film, which means twice the failure. Her direction reminded me of her acting in 'Godfather 3,' a performance that had every critic in America pondering whether she'd look better in a Burger King or a McDonald's uniform.   New tagline for marketing campaign: 'Better than 'Gigli'!'  Forget the 'Saturday Night Live' curse; how about the 'Friends' curse? Death would seem a welcome release compared to a life of starring roles in such gems as 'Ed', 'The Pallbearer' and 'Fools rush in.' Memo to Matthew Perry (and all the 'Friends' for that matter): more Vicadin, not less.   Putting Winona Ryder in an action thriller like 'Alien' makes about as much sense as letting Marlon Brando lead a Jazzercise video. Her character is about as interesting as a pound of alien dung.  Never mind that casting Ben Affleck as a street tough and Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian stretches believability more than casting John Goodman as Peter Pan. Welcome to Hollywood and the Anne Heche-ization of lesbianism. Not only is lesbianism a transitory sexual preference, to be waved around like a Chanel purse, but it's also a great marketing tool!  I just can't emphasize enough how bad it all is. I mean, it's such a disaster it may resurrect Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs' career. He'll be able to defend himself by saying 'at least I didn't make 'Battlefield Earth',' and executives will have to acknowledge that he has a point.   'Bad Boys 2' is a 150-minute life-sucking experience. It's like that scene in 'The Princess Bride' where Prince Humperdink turns the machine up to '50' and sucks 50 years of Wesley's life away.   I don't know where anybody got the idea that Chris Rock could act, but the guy is making about as much progress in his new career as Corey Feldman is as a pop singer.   Since I can do no public service by discussing this film, I'd like to offer some guidelines for filmmakers who consider endeavors of this nature in the future.  1.No more film adaptations of bad American sitcoms.  2.Should, by some oversight, such a film adaptation be made, original cast members may not appear in them -- not even in a pathetic 'hey look, that guy is still alive' cameo.  3.If such a film lasts longer than 85 minutes, the filmmakers shall be considered to be in violation of the audience's basic human rights.  4.Producers are prohibited from casting any of the following people in a speaking role: Tom Arnold, Jim Varney, Ed Begley, Jr., any current or former cast member from Saturday Night Live, any person who was part of the '80s Brat Pack, any member of the Sheen or Baldwin families, Fran Drescher, Florence Henderson and Shelly Long. Especially Shelly Long.  Any violation of above rules will result in the filmmaker's compulsory attendance at next year's Academy Awards ceremony, where he will have his head chopped off onstage in a gala musical tribute to mediocrity.

1093691,male,17,Technology,Taurus,"18,June,2003","           Hi Hi Hi. Well today I accompanied my friend Sarah job hunting, she's so fussy though! She can't work saturdays cos she dances, she can't do after school because she dances, so basically she wants a holiday job that lets her leave at 3.30 everyday, and no weekends. hmmm. We started off in Hamsey Green, but no luck their, just a lot of application forms. We then walked down to sanderstead and we thought we'd got osme luck cos there was s sign in the bakers, but they said they'd already filled it, they just hadn't bothered to take the sign down! So no luck in the rest of the shops in Sanderstead, so we hopped on a bus into Croydon. Clarks said they take on holiday people which was good so we collected a form, and Clintons had a vacancy but it included a Saturday, so no luck. every other shop (Marks, BHS, Alders, HMV, Virgin, Waterstones etc etc) said they haven't got any vacancies till August/October/Christmas. Fun. So we then walked out of Croydon along the Brighton Road to go to 2 music shops, and no luck either! Collapsed into a bus stop on the Brighton Road, looked up and saw a restaurant had a sign in the window advertising for waiters/waitresses, so we went in as a last resort, cos she could do that as it would be evenings! The people in there were so nice and I got a free drink while I waited for her so I was happy after a long day! She got a trial, and then the bloke told me I could aswell! So we're both trainee Waitresses now, lol! Very strange day. Went all round the world, ended up with a job I didn't know I wanted, and then spent the rest of the afternoon in Selsdon Primary photocopying log books from 1955.  Can't be assed to go to IT cos I went yesterday and it was pants, so I'm going to do some revision of my own. Perhaps. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?!         "

The students would be able to provide the learnings and knowledge on lessons that they like to learn with, not some courses that they find appealingless to them. The lessons to them will have application due to the exercises, simulations and quizzes given to them. The system would be able to adjust itself to the learning style of the student. Learning would be essential on the part of the learner since he would be able to track his learning due to the save/load feature, and therefore follow his improvements.

3986440,male,23,Marketing,Leo,"03,August,2004","        Poker has been good to me so far, without being overly nice. Had a good run in a few tournaments, top 20 finishes but still no money. Had a great hand on Aloha when severely short stacked against chip leader early on, went all in pre-flop with Qc4c against AhKh. Flop came Th 4h 4s, turn 4d and the 2h river. Always nice to beat the leader at the table when he has a good hand, but really with felt like that it is just begging for a boat. I don't know if I've said this before, but man I love Quads. Bit of a silly thing to say really - I'm sure everyone loves four of a kind. But for me it is a bit like having your point guard dunking on their center. Can anybody out their remember KJ dunking over Olujuwon? Now there is some contemporary/old school basketball references for you.  I feel a need to comment on a very important aspect of the online poker game - The name you choose to be represented by. The name you select means a lot about you as a player (Huh?), and really can determine if you win or lose (just go with me here.). The names chosen at any poker site fall generally into one of the following categories, and I give my apologies in advance for my lame attempt at l33t for I am no match for the real l33t poker names out there:   1 - 'Local Tourism Board'   Completely made up examples include: 'OhioMan', 'NYPoker', 'JerseyBadMan'.  The 'LTB' player needs to tell people where they were born, are currently living or recently received a wrongfully addressed post card from. There is a sub-division for players who choose to use their college to define their name, even though they dropped out freshman year in 1984. Just how specific they are varies from national monikers (Non-US only, mostly Canadian), state-wide (Mostly US), to the local small one horse town that recently got the Interweb thingy hooked on up. The reason why US players choose state-wide as opposed to a national identity is because they believe that since they exist, it must naturally be assumed that they are from America (the fact that the state they mention is an American state can be ignored for the sake of my argument.). This is deeply entrenched in their genes from an early age, where they watch the 'World Series' being played out by only American teams. Canada has a law where any Canadian person who is likely to come into contact with people from a country other than the US must at all times remind those foreign people that they are Canadian and NOT American. This goes for real life as well as in poker rooms. The 'LTB' player is likely to loose all their chips.   2. 'Poker Terms'   Completely made up examples include: 'PocketAces', 'RiverMan', 'Foldme', 'QueensFull'.  The poker terms player likes to hide their true identity behind any random poker term they find on any poker medium available. Favorite among this all too popular breed are 'pocket' anything. It has been proven by The Greater Univeristy of Poker in North-West Dubbo that by naming yourself after a good starting hand will fool 43.765% of professional players into thinking you have that starting hand on most occasions. The number increases when the hands become higher ( 'PocketKings' = 74.218% and 'BigSlick' = 66.667%). The unfortunately reality of the results of the study from the Greater Univeristy of Poker in North-West Dubbo is that their credibility has been shot to pieces ever since they recommended the best way to win lotto was birthdays. The 'Poker Terms' player is also an expert on all things poker, and as the name suggests they will throw in any poker term they can at any time no matter if it fits or not. Please see example below.   PocketAces:  Ha! Bet you didn't see my boat coming down the river with the cowboys doing the paddling!  RiverMan:  Yeah, but my bullets and hammer UTG sucked out your runner-runner over pair!  PocketAces:  But my button burst your bubble on spades full of broadway with crabs kicker on the blind!  RiverMan:  N00b.  They hate anybody who mentions the movie 'Rounders', and thinks ESPN ruined the true, pure poker that they play. If you beat them it was luck, if they win it was skill. The 'Poker Terms' player is likely to loose all their chips.    3. 'I'm Famous!'    Completely made up examples: 'U5h3r', 'Tr1ppl3HHH18', 'SlimShady', 'DustinDiamond4EVA'.  On rare occasions, the 'I'm Famous' player attempt to convince the rest of the table that they are in fact who their names says they are. While maybe the odd celebrity may try their hand at poker every now and then, I find it hard to believe that they would spend a few hours online trying to win $29.66 (with the exception of Dustin Diamond perhaps. Hey, Screech gotta eat you know.). This is seen as really pathetic, especially when 'BigGuy1955' tries to hit on 'BritneyGurl' and asking if she could show some more skin in her next film clip.(this is of course not confined to online poker.). When the 'I'm famous' player is not trying to impersonate any random celebrity but just honoring them by name, all seems well...That is, until 'SlimShady' sits at the same table as 'R34LSlim' - and nobody stands up no matter how politely you ask and it is best to turn off chat immediately. The 'I'm famous' player is likely to loose all their chips.   4. 'It's Me'.   Completely made up examples include: 'BarrySmith', 'JoyceUK', 'Henry21', 'FitFrank69'.  'It's Me' players really don't understand what the Internet is for, and that is hiding behind an online persona and never letting on to who you relly are. They have chosen a name that even the Boulder City Police could decipher (Jay Leno would be so proud of me right now). With no imagination evident, you can guarantee the 'It's Me' player will either see every single flop just to make sure their 72o is no good, or they will fold everything that isn't pocket aces. When ever anybody wins a hand - no matter in what fashion - they are sure to post 'nh' in the chat box, and give you a 'gg' when they finally loose their stack. When playing against an 'it's Me' player, you must never post anything similar to them, as it will start a never ending run of constanants the likes of Wheel of Fortune only dreams about. See example below:   BarrySmith:  gl all.  JoyceUK : TY.U2.  BarrySmith:  lol. vnh.  JoyceUK:  ROFL :)  BarrySmith:  ty. asl?  JoyceUK:  U BBQ?  BarrySmith:  udg fgrt qzxc?  JoyceUK:  IOU SAD VCR DVD FUBAR.  And on it goes. Do not enter into any discussion about important shit, because it is guaranteed that the 'It's Me' player has a world of experience and an opinion on every matter that your tender years could not understand. This does not include poker, even though they will tell you what you should have done all the time regardless if you won or not. The 'It's Me' player will loose all their chips.   5. 'l33t'.   Completely made up examples: '$3xyH4x0r', '1  The scurge of the internet, online poker rooms are not immune to the 'Leet' player. The have studied the 'shift' key for hours, and experimented with 'crtl' and breifly 'alt', and is even prone to binges of 'Caps Lock'. You are a 'n00b' if you are sitting on the same table as them and dare to speak. Similar to the 'Poker Terms' player, if they beat you then you have been '0wn3d', you stupid fucking noob you. If you beat them, it is because they are so damn drunk right now (they're not). He knows that this poker site is fixed and he has proof (he doesn't). You may beat him but he was on fire last night when he won $10K at the bigger limit tables, he is just slumming it on these tables you are on because he is bored and still so damn drunk (they're still not). The 'leet' will loose all their chips.  Well, there you have it. Try and spot as many of these as you can in your next poker room and already you will have the advantage.  Off the topic of poker, I'm pretty stoked to be going to see the Australian Premier of 'Walking Tall' later this week, and even happier about the fact that The Rock will be there in person. He has been doing all the usual media spots aorund Oz at the moment and is good to listen to. Been watching a bit of Futurama on the weekend, and with quotes like these I don't know why it got cancelled:       'Now the dominoes fall like a house of cards. Check mate!' - Zapp Brannigan.      Damn that was a good show. Now that I have already received a response to my last little update with the links, I will be trying to add one more link per update, be that poker related or not. This week I am adding   urlLink Wrestlecrap  . If you love professional wrestling, or just a good laugh at it, then be sure to have a look. And buy his book too, it's worth a read.

3858248,male,27,indUnk,Aquarius,"07,July,2004","       BAGHDAD, Iraq - A group loyal to insurgency leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi threatened Friday to execute two Bulgarian hostages if the U.S. military did not release all Iraqi detainees within 24 hours, according to a videotape broadcast on the Al-Jazeera television station.   The Tawhid and Jihad group sent Al-Jazeera a video showing the two unidentified Bulgarians sitting with their hands cuffed, flanked by three masked men, two carrying rifles and one carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher. On the wall behind them was their group's black flag with a golden circle.   One of the men read a statement, though his voice could not be heard. Al-Jazeera's newsreader said the group demanded the release of all Iraqi detainees within 24 hours.   The group had previously claimed responsibility for the beheading of U.S. businessman Nicholas Berg and South Korean translator Kim Sun-il. It was also believed to be behind a series of attacks on police and security forces in Iraq (news - web sites) that killed 100 people in the days leading up to the coalition forces' handover of power to an Iraqi interim government last month.   An editor at Al-Jazeera's newsroom in Doha said the channel received the tape Thursday.  --When will these morons learn it's not going to work. Terrorism doesn't work on us or our allies. (with exception to Spain, El Salvador and Honduras) The coalition is strong. Their will is stronger than some terrorists that have a radical agenda for jihad.   Andrew B.     "
3771987,male,42,Education,Capricorn,"28,June,2004","                 I was just watching Michael Moore's documentary, 'Bowling for Columbine.' He's seeking to understand why the U.S. is such a violent country. He examines various reasons that people often gives: video games, violent movies, music lyrics, guns, etc. The most intriguing part is when he interviews various Canadians. Any reason for America's violence that you give, it seems, doesn't make sense when compared with Canada. For example, Canadians play video games, watch violent movies, listen to the same kind of music, and own lots and lots of guns, but very few people get murdered by guns in a year. The clips imply that America's culture of fear is at least partly to blame. For example, Canadians are so relaxed, don't lock their doors, yet have less violent crime (although the people he interviewed did admit that burglars have broken into their homes to steal things). I wonder what sociologists have to say about all this.      "

3908974,female,23,Student,Libra,"25,May,2004","       Stormed like mad last night.    All day clouds were parked over northeast Kansas, turning the weather all gray and sticky and foreboding.  Everyone I talked to said they felt something coming.  Since nothing much ever happens here, the local news was having a fit about it, throwing up pictures of radar and safety warnings and recorded calls of old ladies reporting possible twisting formations they saw from their kitchen windows.  A tornado can kill you.  It can take away your possessions.  It can pull down the walls around you but leave your cup unspilled on your coffee table.  But all we got was rain, which in some perverse way disappointed me.  I want to be stripped of everything sometimes.  I am poor with day to day trivialities and I am slightly socially inept-- I am not punctual.  But I am good in  danger.    It rained harder than it has in years.  The last time it rained like that was the year I ran away from home, can it really be six years ago?  I remember at the time I thought it was a sign.  (I have always been strangely religious for an atheist.)  It rained until the streets looked like rivers.  It was practically Biblical.  I moved here with my best friends from my hometown, and we always did bizarre things just to be doing bizarre things.  It rained so much that we gave up on being dry and just walked around outdoors in our bathing suits.  I was lonesome and estranged from my family, and I was officially a high school dropout.  If I stopped being silly long enough to acknowledge these facts, I would feel a big windy hole in my chest.  (And thunder ripping above me all the while.)  But in the end the sun came out.  I am sure I missed out on a lot of good things in doing what I did, but since I'll never know what I missed, I feel fine.  (The road not taken, I suppose.)  My man was acting kind of weird last night.  We made cookies for my roommate, which was a disaster and not even worth the headache...We had to leave some of them in the oven while we helped contain our friend's cats and hide out while the storm was on.  They turned hard and brown in our absence.  And then she came home-- No love there, we're still in the doghouse for reasons I am losing patience with.    But my man...I thought something was wrong and it made me nervous.  We drove about in the rain, and when we hit campus, I started getting nostalgic about the last time we had a good rain.  I said, Let's go outside!  And there we were, running knee deep through rainwater, with cold drops pelting us so I couldn't stop shrieking from the excitement.  Lightning lit up the sky.  I hope nothing's wrong.  I hope it's not, because in spite of myself, I am all tangled up.  In ways, love is like letting someone hold a blade to your throat.  I have to believe he won't cut me.  But even the slightest thing makes me worry that he will.  I know I am wrong, and that it's probably nothing, and it's unfair to make him pay for what others have done to me.  Gun-shy girl slept alone last night.  Today begins my project of self denial.  I put it so dramatically, but the bottom line is I am going on a diet.

2948199,female,27,Manufacturing,Gemini,"10,June,2004","           So I started to write this big long post about loving men who drive big trucks.  Then work took over and I totally lost my train of thought.  Oh well.  That doesn't change the fact that the bigger the truck, the more I love it.   Old Herb drives a spectacular machine.  At lease he used to.  I've heard he's traded in the one we used to drive to lunch in.  That sucks.  I would have traded a lot of what I own to have that truck, even if I do only drive a mile to work.  She sat so tall and proud, it always took just the right amount of effort to climb up into her.  Well, in jeans at least...getting into that truck in a skirt could have been slightly obscene.  Ok, so you get the idea...I loved that truck.    T-minus 9 days until we get to start moving...but I'm not counting.  My sister is coming over Saturday.  I am FINALLY getting a haircut.  This mop is getting all ratty looking again.  Also gonna recolor it.  The red's almost completely faded now, and with five weeks until race time, I figure this gives me enough time to color and touch it up.  Other than moving, nearly everything I do in the next two months will revolve around the race.  Yes, I'm staying red.  I have to.  Whoever said blondes have more fun has obviously never been (or been with) a redhead....         "

1381825,female,16,indUnk,Scorpio,"07,June,2004","       Today was certainly not the ideal day off. It was pretty icky.  I started feeling a little sick last night, but it wasn't that bad so I just went to be early to try to sleep it off. So this morning my mom offered to take me out to lunch, which is always loads of fun, so we went. It was pretty nice - we went to the Rockford. I love that place. Afterwards, we decided to go to the mall to pick up my glasses. Finally. So we got there and started looking at the el cheapo ones because my dad wants me to try those first. The woman I went to for my prescription basically told me that even a prescription wouldn't help me because it's some funky teenage thing that I'll eventually outgrow. So basically I'm supposed to have a permanent migraine from now until after college. Great. My mom told me, though, that if I didn't like the cheap ones that we could try the prescription just in case. So I started looking through the cheap ones and first of all, they just magnify things, they don't help my problem, and second, they don't come all the way up on your eyes so you have to cock your head back to do any kind of computer work. I couldn't stand them, so I said that we should just try the prescription because my head is killing me. Conveniently enough, my mother left the prescription at home. Lovely. So now I'm tired, have a fever, and I still don't have my glasses. This is when my mom decided she wants to go blouse shopping with me. So we look around and, of course, don't find anything as usual. It was still another hour or so before we could go pick up my sister and go home, so my mom offered to take us to a coffee shop to wait. We got in the car and drove to the cafe. When we got there, my mom saw that there was a new camera store next door, so she sent me to get her drink and then come back. I waited in that camera store for what felt like forever with nowhere to sit down and nothing to do. I started feeling sick to my stomach because the air in there was kind of weird. We finally left and got my sister from school. We got home and I took some medicine for my sore throat and went to bed. I slept for an hour and then got up to do homework. I was supposed to go see my sister's cello concert but I managed to get out of it. So here I am, feeling awful, doing my homework. Some day off.  I want a refund.         "

2155463,male,23,Student,Sagittarius,"25,December,2003","   I think I finally found what I'm looking for, or at least pinpointed the goal I'm trying to reach.  Our pastor talked about yearning for an 'indestructible well-bring of soul' in his message last night, and I think that this is exactly what I've been trying to find.  He used this phrase as a definition of joy, but I think it has so many more meanings to it - joy, contentment, belonging, righteousness, and so many other qualities are wrapped up in the concept of 'well-being.'  I think that I had this at one time, but I know I don't have it now - my soul feels fragile like an egg-shell, cowering in the corner from all the beatings and bruises its taken (i.e. disappointments, etc.).  All I'm looking for, hoping for, praying for is someone who would actually come alongside me and help me, challenge me, prod me towards the path I need to be on - but of course, this has been a hope for several years now, and I've pretty much given up all hope of it actually happening.  Sometimes I just want to scream during church or when I'm with my Christian friends or something, ask what it is about me that makes people so indifferent about my spiritual well-being.  Is it that I'm too passive?  Seemingly too good (well, I could clear up that misconception real quick...)?  Don't seem to have any problems?  Too 'weird,' too caught up in the metaphysical aspects of things?  Not committed enough?  Whatever the reason, I just wish that someone would actually care...but I'm not holding my breath. "

3473351,female,33,Law,Scorpio,"24,June,2004","   My Family and Jesse James  I am the family's resident genealogist. I am aware of how many times I am my own cousin. Big deal. The royals did it, we did it, oh well. Appalachian Royalty has a certain twang and we don't have one eye in the middle of our forehead or hemophilia.   There is a family story, passed on by my Great-Great-Grandmother Julie (Ma-Ma's side). Now G-G-Grandma Julie was about the same age as my Great-Grandmother on my Pa-Pa's side, so she wasn't really THAT old in relation to the rest. She did live to see great-great grandchildren born, just like my Pa-Pa.   The story is that Julie lived with her mother in Pikeville, KY in the late 1800's. Supposedly, her mother ran a boardinghouse in the area, Jesse James stayed there, or rather they hid him while on the lam, and he tipped my g-g-grandmother $50 for bringing him a meal. Now, I'm inclined to believe it was $5 which probably seemed like $50 as she said she was 6 or 7 years old at the time.   Other family genes have discounted this story because supposedly Jesse James was not in that area at the time. Julie was not the type to make up stories of that nature so I was leaning toward Julie. (Now, I never knew her personally, I'm only going on the character reference of my grandfather and grandmother) I dug around and dug around in archives and such looking for clues to Jesse James whereabouts during this time frame.   Finally, I found what I was looking for. I was reading stories on www.crimelibrary.com.  Its my thing. Yes, I read about serial killers and the mob and outlaws. It serves me well. They have a section on Jesse James which is fairly long and involved written by a Civil War buff and BOOYAH! There it is in black and white... he went through KY in August of 1876. Julie would have been 6 or 7 years old at the time as she was born in August 1869. My family were conferedate sympathizers, even though they all deserted, and in old stories were linked to Quantrill's Raiders.   This doesn't prove that Jesse James and my g-g-grandmother ever crossed paths. But it doesn't disprove it either. I'm naturally more inclined to believe the family story, with a grain of salt, that we aided and abetted one of the most notorious outlaws ever. I'm so proud...sniff... does anyone have a tissue? "
1476382,male,33,Publishing,Gemini,"19,May,2004","        A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Rena Xu , who writes for  urlLink Monday's Harvard Crimson :  ' Carrie Bradshaw , heroine of TVs  urlLink Sex and the City , famously remarked in the episode where she models for a New York fashion show, 'When I was broke sometimes I would buy  urlLink Vogue  instead of food. I felt it fed me more.'  'As I recently perused my own copy of Vogue over a meal in Annenberg, it struck me that almost every female body featured in the magazine looked as if it had perhaps skipped one too many meals. Of course, this was no novel discoverythe endless pages of endless legs were little surprise. After all, models are almost always expected to fit an unhealthily tall and skinny image. What was surprising, however, was the fact that the pictures of impossibly thin, bikini-clad models appeared just pages away from an article discussing the serious battle against anorexia and bulimia fought by one of the most prominent of these models ...'  Bravo.   Out :  Graydon Carter , beeyatch. The  urlLink oily Vanity Fair editor  has indeed  urlLink become everything he once detested  when he was a clear-eyed and writer in Spy Magazine, after a childhood yearnings of WASP writerly glamour back in  la Canada , eh? Does it really matter that  urlLink Graydon  has done gone and  sold his ass ?  Certainly it does. And  urlLink my nemesis Toby Young  gets it just about right:  'Well, as someone who worked for  Vanity Fair  from 1995 to 1998, I think it does matter. When I first met Graydon in 1993, he was in the pupae stage of his metamorphosis. He'd left Spy two years earlier ( urlLink the New York Observer  came in between), but hadn't quite settled into his new role. He tried to give the impression that, despite being the captain of this Conde Nast flagship, he remembered what it was like to be a pirate. Two years later, when I became a contributing editor, Graydon still prided himself on not being for sale. He was contemptuous of the publicists who clamored for his attention and urged his staff to put all press releases in 'the circular file.' He made it a point of principle that Vanity Fair, unlike other, lesser magazines, did not grant celebrities copy approval. He encouraged his writers to remain slightly aloof from the world they were covering.  'There were compromises, of course. Sometimes, to gain access to a big star, he had to strike a deal with a publicist and promise to include a less well-known client in the magazine. This D-lister would then appear on the front page of the Vanities section, a slot referred to by the staff as 'blond bimbos on the horizon.'  'But it would have been impossible to edit the magazine without coming to some accommodations with the PR machine. Within these limits, Graydon did his utmost to preserve the independence of the magazine. He knew he was on the losing side in the battle against the culture of celebrity, but he wasn't about to surrender.  'Now, however, he's in thrall to the voodoo priests and priestesses of the entertainment industry, and Vanity Fair is no more tough-minded than any other glossy magazine. The most embarrassing detail of last week's story was that Graydon recently tried to set up meetings at a number of Hollywood studios to pitch the idea of a movie based on a  Vanity Fair  article by  urlLink Nancy Jo Sales , with himself as a producer. (Graydon had stuck a toe in the water when he was one of the producers of the Robert Evans documentary  urlLink 'The Kid Stays in the Picture.')  Despite the best efforts of his agent, however, only one studio granted him an audience--and passed.  'As the co-founder and co-editor of  urlLink Spy , not to mention an outstanding editor in chief of Vanity Fair for more than a decade, Graydon Carter was a giant in journalism. If he had traded in his professional integrity to become the head of a studio, or even for a three-picture deal, that would have been one thing. But he has sacrificed his reputation to become just another hustler scratching around for scraps from the Hollywood table. I always feared he would sell out eventually. I just thought he would have commanded a higher price.'  I did as well.   In :  The Lindsay Lohan breast augmentation theory  got a, uhm,  boost  from that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer , which writes:  ' Lindsay Lohan  is busting out these days. And it's not just thanks to the 17-year-old's hit movie, Mean Girls. 'There is no question in my mind that she has had breast augmentation, and I think the results are very good,' Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Wallace Goodstein tells Star. 'It looks like she has saline implants, which have taken her from a size A or small B to a size C or small D. The bigger breasts look very natural, which is what surgeons aim for,' adds Goodstein, who does not treat Lohan. When contacted, Lindsay's rep  Leslie Sloane Zelnik  laughed it off, saying she's 17 and still growing. But Star got a second opinion anyway. 'What you see is what you've got,' says New York-based cosmetic surgeon Dr.  Geoffrey Tobias . 'It would seem to be obvious... that she did have breast augmentation.''

Hes got British Airways' 'Special Services' on speed dial (no ticket or passport lines, thank you very much), two sets of Vespas parked in London and Paris (the quickest way to make an airport connection), an impossibly chic wife ( French Vogues contributing editor  Masako Kumakura ) whipping up authentic Japanese meals for him at his enormous  Avenue Victor Hugo  apartment in Paris, and a supremely well-connected 'roommate' in London (art curator Alannah Weston, whose daddy owns  Selfridges  and  Fortnum Mason ).

3570175,female,25,indUnk,Cancer,"08,August,2004","       Last night, I decided to forego an exciting Saturday evening out and stay in for the night.  All I can say is, it was lovely listening to a Long Island girl who teaches English in Queens' life story from my window and even lovelier to hear the frat boy slumming it in the East Village point out the large rat he saw at Cafe Gigi to the girl he was mostly likely going to pass out on top of mid-coitus later that night.  Whoohoo.  I woke up feeling as damaged and irritated as I would have if I had gone out, downed three pints, and discussed my boring life with a semi-stranger.   I really need to move somewhere grown-up -- especially now that East Village rents are so overpriced.  Anyhow, besides eavesdropping, I decided to start early on the Sunday Times and watch some news.  My first try was Fox.  (I just rented Outfoxed the other night and made a conscious decision to sit through some Murdoch hell).  Anyhow, that Geraldo sure is dumb.  His journalistic reporting seemed like some kind of Robocop/Starship Troopers/E! hybrid style and I proceeded to yell at him along with the idiot lawyer who is attempting to ban sex toys from America.  What's wrong with America????  What has happened to this lovely land that I love???   Oh yeah, and then I watched the Iraqi war reports and yelled at that too.  Give peace a chance???  Oh yeah, and then I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the Olsen twins are taking over/building a penthouse in a NYU dorm.  Um, since when is that okay?  Why don't they just get their own freakin' apartment.  And jeez, doesn't anyone recall that story about the NYU student who was so broke he had to live in the library?  How are people like that going to feel when they see the Olsen twins in their pad?  This is terrible.   Do people just not think anymore?  Anyhow, as I contemplated just this thought, I clicked to a different channel and rapidly began to grow scared and paranoid as the television screen blinked code orange at me and I was told to beware of cyber-stalking.   As I watched the attractively bland anchorwoman spout facts at me, I recalled my friendster profile and other such things and entered a restless sleep, haunted by death threats, war, and Denise, the teacher from Long Island's loud and nauseating voice.  Yes, I too had succumbed to the television marketing of fear -- on a Saturday night, no less.     "

3510796,female,25,Student,Taurus,"11,July,2004","       So the title of this post is pretty much self explanatory.  I went to a Greek wedding last night and it was something out of the movies.  Yes, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Good guess.  Anyway, they had the cake and all the other desserts and the polkas(which by the way are polish) AND they had the Greek dances where everyone dances around in a circle, or something.  I went outside when all that fun started.  Before all the dancing though, the best man gave about a ten minute speech, but it was well worth it.  The bar was only serving Bud and Bud light, amongst all the 'hard' liquor.  I saw some bottles of Miller Light and went on a mission to find where they were coming from.  Seems as though the wedding party had a cooler full of them from the Transpo Trolley(instead of renting a limo, they got the city transpo trolley to drive them around downtown south bend)  So being the good friend that I am of the bride, I got me some beer worth drinking for the rest of the night.  Good food, great company and an even better kisser made the night.     Sports Report  Looks like the wooden broom took a shit.

572994,male,24,Religion,Libra,"22,June,2004","                 recently, i had someone ask me if i always had turned to God (in terms of over time). well, the answer to that isn't as simple as it should be. i always knew about God. i was brought into the Lord's company as a small child. in retrospect (looking at my life over the years) i know that God had me then as He has me even now. i just didn't pursue Him like i should've. i am glad that i was asked that question. no i have not always turned to God, but He has always been right there anyway.  yesterday i ogt up early and felt pretty good about doing my Bible study in the morning as opposed to at night. the truth is i woke up because i had a bad dream. probobly the worst dream a man that loves a woman can dream, and after nearly squeezing the life out of wife after waking up (and waking her up which was not so good an idea), i sought refuge in the Word. i do the same now. i am feeling like i am slowly drifting back into the doomloop that has been my walk over the last four years. i want God and all of His love and affection, but i know that even if i do not feel that, i carry on in obedience. 'as i walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name'    are you so foolish? after beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort? - Galatians 3:3   chapter 3 of Galatians focuses on the church's attempts to receive the Spirit by obeying the law. it is only to believe. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law...   ...cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree. - Galatians 3:13   He even took on the curse of the law so that we could be blessed as Abraham was. Christ took all of this on because God wanted to be intimate with us. He missed us. He made the first move. He died a sinner's death after living a perfect life, so now we act on that blessing. HE MADE THE FIRST MOVE. grace is freedom from the law. We respect the law, and we obey it for the reason of having God glorified through our works, but our relationship with Him and our salvation comes from Christ and Christ alone. His wounds healed us. each lash of the whip was for our iniquity. that is love, i want to be intimate with that God, Jesus is King of the World and I submit to His perfect will.    This world has nothing for me, and this world has everything - Caedmon's Call                "
